        <p>Your data, bananas, and everything in between (now with more legalese!).</p>
      </header>

      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes how GlitchTeks (“we,” “us,” or “our”)
          collects, uses, and discloses your personal information when you
          access or use our website (the “Service”). By continuing to browse
          or use our website, you consent to the practices outlined in this
          Policy.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
          We may collect the following types of information:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Such as your username, email address, and any other info you provide through forms or account registration.</li>
          <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We use analytics tools to collect data about how you interact with our website—pages visited, time spent, and any bananas flung at us (digitally speaking).</li>
          <li><strong>Cookies &amp; Similar Technologies:</strong> Cookies help us remember your preferences and keep you logged in, if applicable. You can disable cookies in your browser, but some features might break or not function as intended.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Use of Data</h2>
        <p>
          GlitchTeks uses your information to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Provide &amp; Improve the Service:</strong> We constantly tweak our code to ensure a glitch-free (well, mostly) user experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Communicate With You:</strong> If you opt in, we’ll send out important updates, tips, or the occasional banana-related pun.</li>
          <li><strong>Comply With Legal Obligations:</strong> Where required, we may retain or disclose your data to meet regulatory or law enforcement requests.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Data Sharing &amp; Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          We do not sell your personal data to third parties, but we may share
          certain information with:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Trusted partners who assist us in operating our website or performing analytics.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If compelled by court order, subpoena, or other legal processes, we will comply.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          We take commercially reasonable measures to safeguard the information
          we collect. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100%
          secure (especially in a chaotic digital jungle). Use the Service at
          your own risk.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>International Transfers</h2>
        <p>
          Our servers might be located outside your country, and our banana code
          might travel across various jurisdictions. By using our Service, you
          consent to the transfer of your data to locations with different data
          protection rules than your home country.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to access,
          update, or delete personal information we hold about you. If you
          want to exercise these rights, please contact us at:
          <a href="mailto:chimp@glitchteks.io">chimp@glitchteks.io</a>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          GlitchTeks is not directed at individuals under the age of 13. We do
          not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you
          believe we’ve collected data from a minor, please let us know
          immediately so we can purge it from our servers.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time by posting a new
          version on this page. Any changes become effective immediately upon
          posting. Your continued use of the Service after the updated Policy
          takes effect indicates your acceptance.
        </p>
