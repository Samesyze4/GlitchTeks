        <p>Your data, bananas, and everything in between (with extra legalese!).</p>

        <article>
          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes how GlitchTeks (“we,” “us,” or “our”)
            collects, uses, and discloses your personal information when you
            access or use our website (the “Service”). By continuing to browse
            or use our website, you consent to the practices outlined in this
            Policy.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>Data Collection</h3>
          <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Personal Information:</strong> Such as your username, 
              email address, and any other info you provide through forms or 
              account registration.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Usage Data:</strong> We use analytics tools to collect data 
              about how you interact with our website—pages visited, time spent, 
              and any bananas flung at us (digitally speaking).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cookies &amp; Similar Technologies:</strong> Cookies help us 
              remember your preferences and keep you logged in, if applicable. 
              You can disable cookies in your browser, but some features might 
              not function as intended.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Use of Data</h3>
          <p>GlitchTeks uses your information to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Provide &amp; Improve the Service:</strong> We constantly tweak 
              our code to ensure a glitch-free (well, mostly) user experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Communicate With You:</strong> If you opt in, we’ll send out 
              important updates, tips, or the occasional banana-related pun.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Comply With Legal Obligations:</strong> Where required, we may 
              retain or disclose your data to meet regulatory or law enforcement 
              requests.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>Data Sharing &amp; Disclosure</h3>
          <p>
            We do not sell your personal data to third parties, but we may share
            certain information with:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Service Providers:</strong> Trusted partners who assist us 
              in operating our website or performing analytics.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If compelled by court order, 
              subpoena, or other legal processes, we will comply.

        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>Data Security</h3>
          <p>
            We take commercially reasonable measures to safeguard the information
            we collect. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100%
            secure (especially in a chaotic digital jungle). Use the Service at
            your own risk.
          </p>

        <article>
          <h3>International Transfers</h3>
          <p>
            Our servers might be located outside your country, and our banana code
            might travel across various jurisdictions. By using our Service, you
            consent to the transfer of your data to locations with different data
            protection rules than your home country.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>Your Rights</h3>
          <p>
            Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to access,
            update, or delete personal information we hold about you. If you
            want to exercise these rights, please contact us at:
            <a href="mailto:samesyge@proton.me">samesyge@proton.me</a>.

          <p>
            GlitchTeks is not directed at individuals under the age of 13. We do
            not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you
            believe we’ve collected data from a minor, please let us know
            immediately so we can purge it from our servers.
          </p>

        <article>
          <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
          <p>
            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time by posting a new
            version on this page. Any changes become effective immediately upon
            posting. Your continued use of the Service after the updated Policy
            takes effect indicates your acceptance.
